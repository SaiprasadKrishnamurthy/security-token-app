<h2>A simple security gateway server that performs Authentication, Authorization and Service Level Agreement (SLA) checks.</h2>
<br />
Here is how it works:

<b>Step 1:</b>  The Administrators create access rules using the Rule Resource API. These rules govern which URI needs what permission tokens
to consume using a specific HTTP verb. Also, it can additionally define how many requests (transactions) are allowed within a specific time
window for users with specific permission tokens. This is basically the service level agreement.

<b>Step 2:</b> Once the rules are defined in the system, the user is authenticated using the Authentication Resource endpoint.
There are a lot of canned users provided as part of the APP. These users can be listed using the Users Resource API. The password
 for all the users are <b><i>pass</i></b>

 <b>Step 3:</b> Upon successful authentication, the users will get a signed Jason Web Token (JWT).

 <b>Step 4:</b> The users will then need to pass this token in the http Authorization header (using the Bearer schema) to the Authorization Resource API to get the
 authorization and SLA checks performed.

 <b>Step 5:</b> This set up uses an embedded LDAP for user store and a in-memory H2 database as a DB. However, they can be easily switched
  to a real LDAP and DB as a matter of configuration.

  <b>It's built using Java 8 + Spring Boot (as the micro framework).</b>

  <b> Health and Metrics Endpoints:  Just the basic health and metrics are exposed via /health and /metrics via GET respectively.</b>

<b>HATEOAS support is provided for Rule Resource only<b/>

<b>A few canned access rules are already created in the system for reference and can be accessed via the rules resource:  /rules</b>
