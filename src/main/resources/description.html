<h2>A simple security gateway server that performs Authentication, Authorization and Service Level Agreement (SLA)
    checks.</h2>
<br/>

<b>Background:</b>
We felt a common need for Authentication & Authorisation & Service Level Agreement Checks for a lot of resources accessed via HTTP.  The idea is to simply provide these capabilities as a service that is based on industry standards, stateless, lightweight and easy to operate.

<b>Authentication:</b>
Authenticates the user against a user store and generates a token (valid for a configurable period of time). This token is generated using the industry standard Json Web Token (https://jwt.io/).

<b>Authorisation:</b>
Every request then is passed into the Authorisation API to check if the user has got the right permissions to access the protected resource and has not exceeded the quota of number of requests.
These access rules are defined by the administrator using the Rules Resource API. These govern the rules that define the access control policies of your system. The authorisation checks are purely based on the permission tokens associated with the user.


<b>Here is a typical workflow (step by step):</b>

<b>Step
    1:</b>  The Administrators create access rules using the Rule Resource API. These rules govern which URI needs what permission tokens
to consume using a specific HTTP verb. Also, it can additionally define how many requests (transactions) are allowed within a specific time
window for users with specific permission tokens. This is basically the service level agreement.

<b>Step
    2:</b> Once the rules are defined in the system, the user is authenticated using the Authentication Resource endpoint.
There are a lot of canned users provided as part of the APP. These users can be listed using the Users Resource API. The password
for all the users are <b><i>pass</i></b>

<b>Step 3:</b> Upon successful authentication, the users will get a signed Jason Web Token (JWT).

<b>Step
    4:</b> The users will then need to pass this token in the http Authorization header (using the Bearer schema) to the Authorization Resource API to get the
authorization and SLA checks performed.

<b>Step
    5:</b> This set up uses an embedded LDAP for user store and a in-memory H2 database as a DB. However, they can be easily switched
to a real LDAP and DB as a matter of configuration.

<b>It's built using Java 8 + Spring Boot (as the micro framework).</b>

<b> Health and Metrics Endpoints: Just the basic health and metrics are exposed via /health and /metrics via GET
    respectively.</b>

<b>HATEOAS support is provided for Rule Resource only</b>
<b>A few canned access rules are already created in the system for reference and can be accessed via the rules resource: /rules</b>
